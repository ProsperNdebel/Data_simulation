# Data Simulation Project

## Project Description

The Data Simulation Project is a Python-based application designed to simulate changes and fluctuations in various data sources over time. It leverages different data APIs to obtain data and uses the Matplotlib library to visualize how the data has evolved over time. The project also incorporates the GamePy library to create dynamic animations that illustrate the changes in the data.

This project is highly versatile and can be applied to a wide range of data sources. For instance, it can obtain data from a Forex API, providing insights into the price fluctuations of specific currencies. Alternatively, it can fetch data from a weather API to display variations in weather conditions, such as humidity, during a specific time frame in a location like Middletown, CT. Furthermore, the Data Simulation Project can accommodate personalized data, allowing users to track changes in their spending habits over daily, monthly, or yearly periods.

## Features

The Data Simulation Project offers the following key features:

1. **Simple Menu:** A user-friendly menu for easy navigation and interaction with the application.
2. **Data Plotter:** Utilizes Matplotlib to generate clear and informative visualizations of the data's evolution.
3. **Data Simulator:** Simulates data changes over user-defined time frames, providing a dynamic view of data fluctuations.
4. **Data Type Picker:** Enables users to select the specific data source they want to simulate.
5. **Data Input Tool:** Allows users to input and simulate personalized data, ensuring flexibility and relevance.
6. **Time Frame Picker:** Provides users with the flexibility to choose the time frame over which they wish to simulate their data.

## Stakeholders

The Data Simulation Project caters to a broad range of stakeholders, including:

- Data analysts and researchers seeking to visualize and analyze changes in various data sources.
- Traders and investors interested in tracking currency fluctuations through Forex data simulations.
- Weather enthusiasts looking to explore weather data variations in specific locations and time frames.
- Individuals interested in monitoring and understanding changes in their personal data, such as spending habits.

The project serves anyone seeking to gain insights into how data evolves over time, making it a valuable tool for both personal and professional use.
