# Data_simulation
This is a python project that uses various data APIs to simulate changes/fluctuations of that data over time

## Project Description
Data simulator queries data from an API and uses matplot library to plot how the data has changed over time. This project also uses gamepy to 
animate how that data has changed over time. The data could be coming from a forex API that has data on how prices for a particular currency has 
changed. Another instance of where the data could coming from is the weather API, that shows say how the humidity has varied during one day in 
Middletown CT. This project can work with any kind of data and can be extended to encompass personalized data like how someone's spending has changed
over some basis(daily, monthly, yearly basis)
