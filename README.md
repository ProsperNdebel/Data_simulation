# Data Simulation Project

## Project Description

The Data Simulation Project is a Python-based application designed to simulate changes and fluctuations in various data sources over time. It leverages different data APIs to obtain data and uses the Matplotlib library to visualize how the data has evolved over time. The project also incorporates the GamePy library to create dynamic animations that illustrate the changes in the data.

This project is highly versatile and can be applied to a wide range of data sources. For instance, it can obtain data from a Forex API, providing insights into the price fluctuations of specific currencies. Alternatively, it can fetch data from a weather API to display variations in weather conditions, such as humidity, during a specific time frame in a location like Middletown, CT. Furthermore, the Data Simulation Project can accommodate personalized data, allowing users to track changes in their spending habits over daily, monthly, or yearly periods.

## Features

The Data Simulation Project offers the following key features:

1. **Simple Menu:** A user-friendly menu for easy navigation and interaction with the application.
2. **Data Plotter:** Utilizes Matplotlib to generate clear and informative visualizations of the data's evolution.
3. **Data Simulator:** Simulates data changes over user-defined time frames, providing a dynamic view of data fluctuations.
4. **Data Type Picker:** Enables users to select the specific data source they want to simulate.
5. **Data Input Tool:** Allows users to input and simulate personalized data, ensuring flexibility and relevance.
6. **Time Frame Picker:** Provides users with the flexibility to choose the time frame over which they wish to simulate their data.

## Stakeholders

The Data Simulation Project caters to a broad range of stakeholders, including:

- Data analysts and researchers seeking to visualize and analyze changes in various data sources.
- Traders and investors interested in tracking currency fluctuations through Forex data simulations.
- Weather enthusiasts looking to explore weather data variations in specific locations and time frames.
- Individuals interested in monitoring and understanding changes in their personal data, such as spending habits.

The project serves anyone seeking to gain insights into how data evolves over time, making it a valuable tool for both personal and professional use.


# Prerequisites and installation instructions
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following Python modules installed:

- Flask
- Requests
- Flask-CORS
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Trader_Made
- Unittest
- Datetime

You can install these modules using pip3 and the following commands:
- pip3 install flask 
- pip3 install requests
- pip3 install flask-cors 
- pip3 install pandas 
- pip3 install plotly 
- pip3 install tradermade 
- pip3 install unittest 
- pip3 install datetime

# How to Run the Project
1. Clone the project from github with the command(git clone)
2. Then make sure you are in the main directory (cd Data_simulation)
3. Run the command python3 app.py
4. Open a web browser(Chrome or Safari is recommended) and enter the URL displayed in the terminal to access the app
5. On the main screen you will see an empty canvas, and clickable cards with data types at the bottom, follow the instrunctions on those cards
6. Note the the APIs I used were free and hence they limit the number of API calls I can make to their endpoints

# Proposed Future Directions and Suggestions for Additional Features
1. **User Profiles**: Implement user profiles for saving preferences and viewing search history.
2. **Geolocation**: Add geolocation services to detect the user's location automatically.
3. **Weather Alerts**: Provide real-time weather alerts and notifications.
4. **Weather Maps**: Integrate interactive weather maps.
5. **Multi-Language Support**: Add support for multiple languages.
6. **Weather Widgets**: Create customizable weather widgets.
7. **Weather Data Sources**: Allow users to choose data sources.
